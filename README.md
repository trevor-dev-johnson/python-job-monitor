🕵️‍♂️ Python Job MonitorA robust, automated tool built in Python to monitor job boards for new postings. This project helps you stay ahead of the competition by tracking specific roles and locations, ensuring you are notified the moment a new opportunity goes live.🌟 Key FeaturesReal-time Monitoring: Automated scraping of major job platforms.Smart Filtering: Filter by keywords, seniority level, and geographic location.Persistence: Uses a local database to track "seen" jobs, preventing duplicate notifications.Custom Notifications: Supports alerts via Discord Webhooks, Slack, or Email.Stealth Mode: Configured with headless browsing and random user agents to mimic human behavior.🏗️ How It WorksThe application follows a linear pipeline to ensure data integrity and timely updates:Request: The script triggers a browser instance (Selenium) to navigate to the job board.Extraction: Relevant data (Title, Company, Link, Date) is parsed from the HTML.Comparison: The script checks the extracted Job IDs against a local SQLite database.Action: If a Job ID is new, it is saved to the database and a notification is sent.⚙️ Installation & Setup1.
